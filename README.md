## Selected topic:

## Reason why I selected my topic: 
* The reason in choosing this topic is to want to know whether or not you can predict human activity from wearble sensor data such as a fitbit.

## Dataset Source:
- NOTE: Only a pre-cleaned/pre-processed version of the dataset was available.
- https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

## Description of my source of data:

- Recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living
- dataset is randomly broken into 2 sets. 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data.
- A group of 30 volunteers with ages ranging from 19 to 48 years were selected for this task. 
- Each person had to follow along with a certain physical activity while wearing a waist-mounted Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. They each had to repeated the activity twice: first with phone mounted on their left side and the second wherever the subject preferred.
- The activities were standing, sitting, laying down, walking, walking downstairs and upstairs. 

### How data is incorporated with the model:

## Questions I hope to answer with the data
- Whether or not you can predict what specific physical activities one is performing:
  - Can you differentiate between walking on a flat surface, walking up stairs and/or down stairs?
  - Is it possible to determine the difference between sitting, standing and laying? If so, how are these differentiated?

## Description of the data exploration phase of the project
1. Load Data
2. Balance of Activity Classes
  A good first check of the data is to investigate the balance of each activity.
3. Plot Time Series Data for One Subject
  time series data,  an import check is to create a line plot of the raw data.
4. Plot Histograms Per Subject
  There must be regularity in the movement data across subjects. The data has been scaled between -1 and 1, presumably per subject, so the amplitude of the subjectsâ€™ detected movements will be similar.
6. Plot Histograms Per Activity
  interested in discriminating between activities based on activity data.
7. Plot Activity Duration Boxplots
  A final area to consider is how long a subject spends on each activity.


## Description of the analysis phase of the project
* For the analysis phase, I utilized a confusion matrix to look at the performance of my SVM model.
* As indicated in the confusion matrix, the model was able to predict when a subject was laying with 100% accuracy (i.e. a probability of 1.00).
* The least accurate prediction was for sitting (90% i.e. 0.90).

## Machine Learning Portion
### Description of preliminary data preprocessing
* The available dataset was already pre-cleaned but still analyzed to make sure quality data was being used. (Reference "Description of the data exploration phase of the project")

### Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including decision-making process
* Preliminary feature engineering examined 6 different features: sitting, standing, laying, walking, walking up stairs and walking down stairs. These features were selected based on the activities that were recorded by the wearable and associated with that specific activity.

### Description of how data was split into training and testing sets

* The data set was split 70% training and 30% testing based on Activity 

### Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen because it is a good place to start when someone is not sure of the data. The advantages for this dataset also outweigh the disadvantages which was a large part in the choice of this model.
* Advantages: Works well when there is a good margin between classes, computationally efficient.
* Disadvantages: Doesn't work well with a lot of noise (i.e. when target classes overlap), or with large data sets.
