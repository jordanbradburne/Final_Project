Communication Protocol: Individual project

## Selected topic: 
* Modeling human activity from smartphone data

## Reason why I selected my topic: 
* The reason in choosing this topic is to want to know whether or not you can predict human activity from wearble sensor data such as a fitbit.

## Dataset Source:
- NOTE: Only a pre-cleaned/pre-processed version of the dataset was available.
- https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

## Description of my source of data:

- Recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living
- dataset is randomly broken into 2 sets. 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data.
- A group of 30 volunteers with ages ranging from 19 to 48 years were selected for this task. 
- Each person had to follow along with a certain physical activity while wearing a waist-mounted Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. They each had to repeated the activity twice: first with phone mounted on their left side and the second wherever the subject preferred.
- The activities were standing, sitting, laying down, walking, walking downstairs and upstairs. 

### How data is incorporated with the model:

## Questions I hope to answer with the data
- Whether or not you can predict what specific physical activities one is performing:
  - Can you differentiate between walking on a flat surface, walking up stairs and/or down stairs?
  - Is it possible to determine the difference between sitting, standing and laying? If so, how are these differentiated?
