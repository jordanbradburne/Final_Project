Communication Protocol: Individual project

✓ Selected topic: Modeling human activity from smartphone data

✓ Reason why they selected their topic: The reason in choosing this topic is to want to know whether or not you can predict human activity from wearble sensor data such as a fitbit.

✓ Description of their source of data:

Recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living

The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

A group of 30 volunteers with ages ranging from 19 to 48 years were selected for this task. Each person was instructed to follow a protocol of activities while wearing a waist-mounted Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone. The six selected ADL were standing, sitting, laying down, walking, walking downstairs and upstairs. Each subject performed the protocol twice: on the first trial the smartphone was fixed on the left side of the belt and on the second it was placed by the user himself as preferred

✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data
- Whether or not you can predict what specific physical activities one is performing:
  - Can you differentiate between walking on a flat surface, walking up stairs and/or down stairs?
  - Is it possible to determine the difference between sitting, standing and laying? If so, how are these differentiated?
