# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Kaggle is the database I intend to use.

## Machine Learning
SVM is the machine learning approach we will be using.

## Dashboard
Not decided yet, but will most likely be using a Flask template and will potentially create an interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on Tableau Public.
